Working in teams, your students will learn essential astronomy and physics lessons in a fully immersive environment, sparking more curiosity and engagement than through traditional instruction. How do stars and planets form, what impacts planetary orbits, which stars lead to violent supernovae and the formation of black holes â€“ these and many other questions will be explored by students in a phenomena-based interactive learning environment.",
